### Quick Start

1. **Run the Working Demo:**

   ```bash
   php examples/agentic-ai/working-agentic-demo.php
   ```

2. **Try the Personal Assistant:**

   ```bash
   # Optional: Set OpenAI API key for enhanced capabilities
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"

   php examples/agentic-ai/personal-assistant-agent.php
   ```

3. **Explore Multi-Agent Coordination:**
   ```bash
   php examples/agentic-ai/multi-agent-orchestrator.php
   ```

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.1+
- Composer dependencies installed
- Access to MCP servers (included in examples)
- Optional: OpenAI API key for enhanced AI reasoning

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Task Analysis

```php
// Agent analyzes task to understand intent
$analysis = $agent->analyzeTask("Research AI trends and create a blog post");
// Result: type='research', complexity='complex', steps=3
```

### 2. Strategic Planning

```php
// Agent creates execution plan
$plan = $agent->createExecutionPlan($task, $analysis);
// Result: Multi-step plan with tool selection and reasoning
```

### 3. Tool Orchestration

```php
// Agent executes tools in sequence
foreach ($plan['steps'] as $step) {
    $result = await $agent->executeStep($step);
    $agent->updateContext($step, $result);
}
```

### 4. Error Adaptation

```php
// Agent handles failures and finds alternatives
try {
    $result = await $client->callTool($tool, $params);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    $alternative = $agent->findAlternativeApproach($tool, $params);
    $result = await $client->callTool($alternative['tool'], $alternative['params']);
}
```

### 5. Result Synthesis

```php
// Agent combines results into coherent response
$finalResponse = $agent->synthesizeResponse($task, $plan, $results);
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Applications

### Business Automation

- **Customer Support**: Multi-step issue resolution
- **Data Analysis**: Complex analytical workflows
- **Content Management**: Automated content creation
- **Project Management**: Task coordination and tracking

### Development Assistance

- **Code Review**: Multi-file analysis and suggestions
- **Documentation**: Auto-generation from codebases
- **Testing**: Intelligent test case generation
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment workflows

### Research and Analysis

- **Market Research**: Multi-source data gathering
- **Competitive Analysis**: Comprehensive competitor research
- **Trend Analysis**: Pattern identification and forecasting
- **Report Generation**: Automated insight compilation

## ðŸ”§ Architecture Patterns

### Single Agent Pattern

```php
$agent = new AgenticAgent();
await $agent->initialize();
$result = await $agent->processComplexTask($userRequest);
```

### Multi-Agent Pattern

```php
$orchestrator = new MultiAgentOrchestrator();
$orchestrator->registerAgent('research', new ResearchAgent());
$orchestrator->registerAgent('content', new ContentAgent());
$result = await $orchestrator->executeWorkflow($complexWorkflow);
```

### Agent Specialization

```php
// Specialized agents for specific domains
$researchAgent = new ResearchAgent();      // Information gathering
$contentAgent = new ContentCreationAgent(); // Content generation
$analysisAgent = new DataAnalysisAgent();   // Data processing
$planningAgent = new PlanningAgent();       // Strategic planning
```

## ðŸ§ª Testing and Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Test individual examples
php working-agentic-demo.php

# Test with real MCP servers
php personal-assistant-agent.php

# Test multi-agent coordination
php multi-agent-orchestrator.php
```

### Development Tips

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with rule-based reasoning before adding LLM integration
2. **Test Incrementally**: Test each component (planning, execution, synthesis) separately
3. **Handle Failures**: Always plan for tool failures and network issues
4. **Context Management**: Keep context relevant and clean up stale data
5. **Performance**: Consider async execution for parallel operations

### Debugging

Enable verbose mode for detailed execution logs:

```php
$agent = new AgenticAgent(verbose: true);
```

Monitor tool execution:

```php
$agent->onToolExecution(function($tool, $params, $result) {
    echo "Tool: {$tool}, Result: " . json_encode($result) . "\n";
});
```

## ðŸ”® Advanced Patterns

### Learning Agents

```php
class LearningAgent extends AgenticAgent {
    public function learnFromExecution(array $execution) {
        // Analyze what worked and what didn't
        // Improve future planning based on results
    }
}
```

### Collaborative Agents

```php
class CollaborativeAgent extends AgenticAgent {
    public function shareKnowledge(AgenticAgent $otherAgent) {
        // Share execution history and learned patterns
        // Coordinate on complex tasks
    }
}
```

### Adaptive Agents

```php
class AdaptiveAgent extends AgenticAgent {
    public function adaptToEnvironment() {
        // Discover new tools and capabilities
        // Adjust strategies based on available resources
    }
}
```
