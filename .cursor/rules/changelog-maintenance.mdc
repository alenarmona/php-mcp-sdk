# Changelog Maintenance Requirements

## IMPORTANT: Always Review and Update the Changelog

The [CHANGELOG.md](mdc:CHANGELOG.md) file must be maintained for every change to the PHP MCP SDK.

### Before Starting Any Work

1. **Review the changelog** to understand:

   - Recent changes that might affect your work
   - Current version and unreleased changes
   - Any deprecated features to avoid using

2. **Check for conflicts** with ongoing work listed in "Unreleased"

### After Completing Changes

1. **Update the changelog** immediately with:

   - Clear description of what changed
   - Category (Added/Changed/Deprecated/Removed/Fixed/Security)
   - Any breaking changes or migration notes
   - Dependencies added or updated

2. **Format entries** properly:

   ```markdown
   ### Added

   - Brief description of new feature or capability
   - Another new feature with explanation if needed

   ### Changed

   - What was modified and why (if not obvious)

   ### Fixed

   - Bug that was fixed with issue reference if applicable
   ```

### Changelog Update Checklist

When making changes, ensure the changelog includes:

- [ ] All new features or capabilities added
- [ ] Any changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Bug fixes with clear descriptions
- [ ] New dependencies or dependency updates
- [ ] Breaking changes highlighted with migration notes
- [ ] Security fixes (if applicable)
- [ ] Deprecation notices for features being phased out

### Examples of Good Changelog Entries

✅ **Good**: "Added `McpServer::registerBatchTools()` method to register multiple tools at once, improving initialization performance"

❌ **Bad**: "Updated server code"

✅ **Good**: "Fixed memory leak in `StdioTransport` when handling messages larger than 1MB"

❌ **Bad**: "Fixed bug"

### Remember

- The changelog is for humans, not machines - write clearly
- Include the "why" when the reason isn't obvious
- Group related changes together
- Keep entries concise but informative
- Update immediately after changes to avoid forgetting details

**Note**: If you're unsure about how to categorize a change, review the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com) guidelines linked in the changelog header.
